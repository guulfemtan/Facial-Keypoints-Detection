# Facial-Keypoints-Detection
Facial Keypoints Detection predicts key landmark points on human faces from images. Using a dataset of facial images with annotated keypoints, machine learning models are trained to accurately detect features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, enabling applications in facial recognition, animation, and medical analysis.
